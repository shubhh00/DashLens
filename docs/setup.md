# Setup

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio with JDK 17+
- An Android device or emulator with microphone support
- [Agora CLI](https://github.com/AgoraIO/cli)
- Python 3.10+
- A development tunnel provider such as Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, Tailscale Funnel, or LocalTunnel

## Recommended Setup

The easiest path is to let the Agora CLI scaffold the app, bind an Agora project, and write the App ID and Certificate to the Python server environment.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://dl.agora.io/cli/install.sh | sh
agora --help
agora login
agora init my-android-demo --template android
cd my-android-demo
python3 -m venv server/.venv
source server/.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r server/requirements-dev.txt
cp -n server/.env.example server/.env.local
agora project env write server/.env.local
./server/run.sh
```

In another terminal, start a tunnel, configure Android with its public HTTPS URL, and build:

```bash
./server/tunnel.sh --provider ngrok
./server/configure-android.sh https://your-public-host
JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home" ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

`agora init` clones this starter, selects or creates an Agora project, and writes `.agora/project.json`. Agora credentials remain in `server/.env.local`.

## Working From A Clone

Use this if you already cloned this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Conversational-AI/agent-quickstart-android.git
cd agent-quickstart-android
agora login
python3 -m venv server/.venv
source server/.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r server/requirements-dev.txt
cp -n server/.env.example server/.env.local
agora project env write server/.env.local --project <your-project> --template standard
agora project doctor --deep
./server/run.sh
```

In another terminal, run `./server/tunnel.sh --provider <provider>`, use `./server/configure-android.sh` to write the public URL to root `local.properties`, then build the app.

The helper supports `cloudflare`, `ngrok`, `tailscale`, and `localtunnel`. [Local HTTPS tunnels](local-tunnels.md) documents the requirements and direct commands for each provider.

## Manual Setup

Use this only if you are not using the Agora CLI.

### 1. Create An Agora Project

Create or choose an Agora project with Conversational AI enabled.

You need:

- `App ID`
- `App Certificate`
- access to RTC and RTM for the project

### 2. Clone This Repo

```bash
git clone <your-fork-or-repo-url>
cd agent-quickstart-android
```

### 3. Add Server Config

Put Agora credentials in `server/.env.local`:

```properties
AGORA_APP_ID=your_agora_app_id
AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE=your_agora_app_certificate
AGORA_AGENT_UID=123456
```

After starting the local HTTP server and public HTTPS tunnel, put only this value in root `local.properties`:

```properties
QUICKSTART_SERVER_URL=https://your-public-host
```

If the tunnel assigns a new URL, run `server/configure-android.sh` again and rebuild or reinstall the Android app because these values are compiled into `BuildConfig`.

### 4. Build And Run

```bash
JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home" ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

Open the project in Android Studio, or run it from the command line, then launch it on a device or emulator.

Tap **Start voice session**, allow microphone permission, speak to the agent, and watch transcripts appear in realtime. Use the end-session control to stop the conversation cleanly.

## Required Configuration

Required in `local.properties`:

- `QUICKSTART_SERVER_URL`

Required in `server/.env.local`:

- `AGORA_APP_ID`
- `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE`

`AGORA_AREA` selects the Agora API routing region. Supported values are `NORTH_AMERICA`, `US`, `EUROPE`, `EU`, `ASIA_PACIFIC`, `AP`, `CHINA`, and `CN`.

## Default Agent Setup

The demo starts the agent with the default Agora-managed stack:

- `deepgram_nova_3`
- `openai_gpt_4o_mini`
- `minimax_speech_2_6_turbo`

It also enables:

- RTM event delivery
- RTM data channel transcripts
- RTM pipeline metrics
- agent subscription scoped to the generated requester RTC UID
- chorus audio scenario for the agent and local RTC engine
- explicit VAD turn detection and speech-triggered interruption
- generated filler phrases after 1.5 seconds, with static fallback phrases

## Text Controls And Project Guidance

During a session, use **Send text to Ada**:

- **Ask Ada** sends an instruction for the LLM to process.
- **Read aloud** sends text directly to speech synthesis.
- **Queue instead of interrupting** defaults to enabled. For instructions, the
  `append` action starts a new turn after the current turn's LLM output finishes;
  it does not guarantee waiting for all current audio playback to finish. For
  direct speech, `APPEND` queues after current speech. Clear the checkbox to
  interrupt immediately.

These controls use the Python backend's `/v1/conversation/think` and
`/v1/conversation/speak` endpoints. RTC/RTM still carries audio and agent events.
The Android Client Toolkit is not required by this implementation.

To let Ada look up this project's setup and troubleshooting guidance, set
`PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-public-host` in `server/.env.local` and restart the
server. Use the same reachable HTTPS backend base URL configured for Android.
Update it and restart after changing tunnel URLs. Start a new conversation to
apply agent configuration changes.

The `getProjectGuidance` tool calls `GET /v1/tools/guidance?topic=setup` or
`topic=troubleshooting`. It serves only these two public project documents;
include the repository's `docs` directory when deploying the server. When
`PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is empty, no custom tool is advertised to the agent.

The server pins `agora-agents==2.8.1`. After pulling the update, install
`server/requirements-dev.txt` in a Python 3.10+ environment and restart the server.

## Production Security

This repo uses a backend-orchestrated flow.

It is useful when you want to:

- learn how Agora Conversational AI works end to end
- ship a quick prototype with a minimal backend
- build a reusable Android template for your team
- understand the minimum code needed for a voice AI app

The App Certificate is backend-only. The quickstart endpoints intentionally omit application-user authentication to keep the local demo focused on Agora token generation and agent lifecycle. Add your product's user authentication and authorization at the server boundary before a public production launch.
