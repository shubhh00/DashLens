# Agora Conversational AI Android Quickstart

This repository is a template-style Android starter for building a Voice AI app with Agora Conversational AI.

It gives you a Kotlin + Jetpack Compose app backed by a small Python service that:

- joins an Agora RTC channel
- starts and manages an Agora Conversational AI agent through the backend
- listens for transcript, agent state, and pipeline metrics over RTM
- lets the user talk, mute, interrupt, and end the session
- supports typed instructions, direct speech, and queued requests
- fills long response pauses with generated phrases and static fallbacks
- optionally looks up the project's setup and troubleshooting guidance
- keeps the App Certificate and token generation off the Android device

## Release 1.1.0 — Agora Conversational AI v2.12

This release integrates the Conversational AI Engine's v2.12 features with
`agora-agents==2.8.1` on the Python backend. Android uses RTC `4.6.4` and RTM
`2.3.0`. Engine, Python SDK, and Android SDK versions are independent.

See [the changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for the changes and [setup instructions](docs/setup.md#text-controls-and-project-guidance)
for the new text controls and optional custom tool. Each developer runs their
own backend and configures its HTTPS URL before building the Android app.

> [!NOTE]
> This quickstart requires the included Python backend. Local mobile testing uses a temporary public HTTPS tunnel so the Android device can reach the development server.

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio with JDK 17 or newer
- Python 3.10 or newer
- Bash for the scripts in `server/`
- An Android device or emulator with microphone support
- An Agora account with access to Conversational AI
- A development tunnel provider; the included helper supports Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, Tailscale Funnel, and LocalTunnel

The commands below assume a macOS or Linux shell. On Windows, run the backend scripts from WSL or an equivalent Bash environment.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Agora CLI and sign in

Skip this step if `agora` is already on your `PATH`.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://dl.agora.io/cli/install.sh | sh
agora --help
agora login
```

### 2. Get the quickstart

The recommended path lets the CLI clone the template and bind an Agora project. Replace `my-android-demo` with your app folder name:

```bash
agora init my-android-demo --template android
cd my-android-demo
```

`agora init` selects or creates an Agora project and records the project binding in `.agora/project.json`.

To work from an existing clone instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Conversational-AI/agent-quickstart-android.git
cd agent-quickstart-android
```

If you use an existing clone, you will select the Agora project when you configure the server in the next step.

### 3. Configure and run the Python server

```bash
python3 -m venv server/.venv
source server/.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r server/requirements-dev.txt
cp -n server/.env.example server/.env.local
agora project env write server/.env.local --template standard
./server/run.sh
```

The command above uses the project selected by `agora init`. For an existing clone, select the project explicitly instead:

```bash
agora project env write server/.env.local \
  --project <project-name-or-id> \
  --template standard
./server/run.sh
```

The server listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and keeps `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` off the Android device. Leave this terminal running. The local endpoint uses HTTP; the selected tunnel provider supplies the public HTTPS endpoint required by Android.

### 4. Create a temporary public HTTPS URL

In another terminal, run:

```bash
./server/tunnel.sh --provider ngrok
```

Choose `cloudflare`, `ngrok`, `tailscale`, or `localtunnel` with `--provider`. Keep the tunnel running and copy its generated `https://` URL.

Verify that the public endpoint reaches the Python server:

```bash
curl https://your-public-host/health
```

The response must be backend health JSON, not a tunnel-provider login or warning page. See [Local HTTPS tunnels](docs/local-tunnels.md) for explicit ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnel, Tailscale Funnel, and LocalTunnel commands.

### 5. Configure Android

Write the public server URL to root `local.properties`:

```bash
./server/configure-android.sh https://your-public-host
```

The script writes only this client value:

```properties
QUICKSTART_SERVER_URL=https://your-public-host
```

Do not put `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` in `local.properties`.

### 6. Build the app

```bash
JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home" ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

If your shell already uses JDK 17 or newer, `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` is sufficient.

### 7. Run it

Open the project in Android Studio, or run it from the command line, then launch it on a device or emulator.

Tap **Start voice session**, allow microphone permission, speak to the agent, and watch transcripts appear in real time.

If the agent does not join or transcripts do not appear, run:

```bash
agora project doctor --deep
```

If the temporary tunnel URL changes, run `server/configure-android.sh` again, rebuild, and reinstall the app. For manual setup, optional configuration, and production notes, see [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md).

## What To Read First

If you are using this as a template, start here:

- [ConversationScreen.kt](app/src/main/java/com/androidengineers/agent_quickstart_android/ui/ConversationScreen.kt)
- [ConversationViewModel.kt](app/src/main/java/com/androidengineers/agent_quickstart_android/ui/ConversationViewModel.kt)
- [AgoraConversationSessionManager.kt](app/src/main/java/com/androidengineers/agent_quickstart_android/rtc/AgoraConversationSessionManager.kt)
- [ConversationAgoraApi.kt](app/src/main/java/com/androidengineers/agent_quickstart_android/data/ConversationAgoraApi.kt)
- [Python backend](server/app/main.py)

Those files show the full flow from UI action to Agora session setup.

## What To Customize First

Most teams will customize these pieces first:

1. `ConversationScreen.kt` for UI layout, branding, and session cards
2. `ConversationViewModel.kt` for app state, button actions, and session orchestration
3. `AgoraConversationSessionManager.kt` for RTC, RTM, and media behavior
4. `server/app/agora_client.py` for agent presets, geofence, and model configuration

## Build And Test

Run the Python server tests:

```bash
server/.venv/bin/python -m pytest server/tests
```

Compile Kotlin:

```bash
JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home" ./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin
```

Run unit tests:

```bash
JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home" ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
```

Assemble debug APK:

```bash
JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home" ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

## Security Note

`AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` stays in `server/.env.local` and is never compiled into Android. The Python server generates the Android user's RTC/RTM token and uses the Agora Python SDK to start, interrupt, and stop the agent. A development tunnel URL is public while the tunnel is running, so stop the tunnel when testing is complete and add appropriate application authentication before adapting this demo for production.
